OmniMarkupPreviewer 1.6 Changelog:


NOTE:
1. You may need to restart Sublime Text 2, if anything goes wrong after upgrade.
2. Templates should get updated if they got cutomized.


* Add support to custom the behavior of markdown renderer(through the `"renderer_options-MarkdownRenderer"` option).
* Much better server performance (Thanks to the [`CherryPy`](http://www.cherrypy.org/) server).
