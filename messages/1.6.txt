OmniMarkupPreviewer v1.6 Changelog:


NOTE:
1. You may need to restart Sublime Text 2, if anything goes wrong after upgrade.
2. Templates should get updated if they got cutomized.


* [MathJax] support is now added (through the `"mathjax_enabled"` option), you can
  use `$..$` and `\(..\)` delimiters for inline math, `$$..$$` and `\[..\]` delimiters
  for display math. [MathJax] libraries will be downloaded on demand.
* Add support to custom the behavior of markdown renderer (through the
  `"renderer_options-MarkdownRenderer"` option).
* Much better http server performance (Thanks to the [CherryPy] project).
